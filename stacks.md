<h1>Stacks</h1>
<p>A stack is a linear data structure. It stores items in a list and can be acces from one end or the other.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<p>This is refered to as (LIFO) Last in first out a queue which is the same principle except it is accessed as (FILO) first in last out.</p> 
<h2>Stack vs Queue</h2>
<p>When to use a queue vs a stack. An example would be a line of customers. Whoever is first should be the first out of line. A stack could be used for record keeping, wanting to know the most recent entry.</p>
<h2>Functions</h2>
<p>There are built in functions for the stack that you can use to manipulate the data within or add and take away data.</p>
<ul>
<li>empty()</li>
<li>size()</li>
<li>top()</li>
<li>push(a)</li>
<li>pop()</li>
</ul></p> 

<h3>Empty()</h3>
<hr>
Returns weather the stack is empty or not. <br>Time O(1)
<br>
<br>
<h3>Size()</h3>
<hr>
Returns the size of the stack<br>
Time O(1)
<br>
<br>
<h3>Top()</h3>
<hr>
returns a frefrence to the topmost element of the stack<br>
Time O(1)
<br>
<br>
<h3>Push(a)</h3>
<hr>
inserts the element at the top of the stack<br>
Time O(1)
<br>
<br>
<h3>Pop()</h3>
<hr>
deletes the topmost element of a stack<br>
Time O(1)
<br>
<br>
<h2>Time</h2>
<p>Notice all of the runtimes for each of the functions is the best possible O(1). This means that regardless of the size of data it will be close to instantanious. </p>
